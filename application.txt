Respected Sir,
I want to state that I am a student of B.tech CSE 4th sem. Today in the morning i was 15 min late for my morning class that was the first lecture in daa lab.
The reason I was late was due to i was visiting the dispensary as i had severe body pain. Thats why i was late for todays class. And im sorry for it . i will not repeat this kind of action in near future.
please forgive me this time ...i shall be very thankful to u..
urs Sincerely
